Project Tic Tac Toe is simple browser based game. if 'X' or 'O' wins an alert window with a nice animation will popup.

### How the game is build:    
The game is built in HTML, CSS, JS & jQuery. I have started to create the game with HTML and then styled it with CSS. I also used animated transparent pictures to make the game more interesting. Then I wrote the logic in javaScript and jQuery.
